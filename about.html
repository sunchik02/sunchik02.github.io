      <p class="paratext">Most of my early life was spent focusing on getting through things, school, work that I never explored my intersts. Graphic Design however was something that piqued my interest while taking an entry level class as I liked the mix of art and digital technology. It was during that class that I learned more about the program and chose my new path.
        <br><br>

        Shortly after completing school I had a life changing moment and took an opportunity as a Sales Representative with my current employer to move to the Bay Area. I spent the next 12 years gaining skills and taking opportunities as they came with companies such as Kraft Foods, Farmers Insurance, Safeway Corporate and Coca Cola. My experience from there involved sales, logistics, data analytics, order management and Route process management.
        <br><br>


        While I always excelled at my jobs, made the best of each position and team, I needed a change. I always had a creative side and that was fulfilled with DIY projects and simple crafts for my own pleasure. It was during my time at Coca Cola that I realized I needed to start finding what I was passionate about. The week I started working on my new career path and interests, I found out I was going to become a mom, and it was during my leave I decided to focus on my new future.
        <br><br>

        I started exploring different paths and UX design stood out after learning that is was a great combination of analytics and design.  I realized that this was the perfect area to combine my years of experience in data analytics, collaboration, and detailed plan optimization along with my education in graphic design.  After looking at schools and programs, it was Bloc that I felt would fit my new lifestyle and needs while providing a diverse course of both UX and UI which would benefit skillset.
        <br><br>


        I look at design two ways, functional and appealing. People today don’t have the attention spans that they used to and if something doesn’t work or function well they move on quickly. As not only a designer, but a user I feel it’s important to design a product that eliminates user frustration while also visually pleasing.
        <br><br>


        My years in analyst and planning roles have given me a different mindset when it comes to designing. I like to think of the user, efficiency and practicality. I have spent many years trying to determine time, cost and productivity efficiency. Products need to make sense to the user, save them time and have what they need when they need it.<br><br> </p>
